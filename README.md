# Credit_Risk_Analysis

**Overview**

This analysis employed machine learning to train the device to perform analysis on credit card risk. We employed the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to create models that could study credit card risk. We then utilized six different algorithms: RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier. We oversampled the data using the first two algorithms, undersampled it using ClusterCentroids, did a combination of oversampling and undersampling using SMOTEENN, and then used the final two algorithms to compare models that help reduce bias in the data presented.
